You are the Lead Forensic Investigator assigned to this case. The SOC has isolated the Numbers_Never_Lie.zip file and transferred it to your secure environment for analysis.
Your objective is not just to open the folders, but to decode the intent behind them. The attacker has fragmented the stolen data across multiple number bases. To recover the final artifact and prove the attribution, you must:
1.	Navigate the Labyrinth: Explore the directory structure. Do not be fooled by file extensions or surface-level text.
2.	Decode the "Polyglot": You will encounter clues that look like gibberish to the untrained eye. You must recognize and convert these strings to readable to find next clues.
3.	Document the Chain of Custody: Create a comprehensive forensic report detailing your investigation. You must list every finding and include screenshots of all terminal commands used and their corresponding results to validate your methodology.
The automated tools have failed. The file is open, but the truth is locked behind the numbers. It is up to you to find it.
